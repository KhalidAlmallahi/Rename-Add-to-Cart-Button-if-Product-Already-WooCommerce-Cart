# Rename “Add to Cart” Button if Product Already @ WooCommerce Cart

When talking about UX, or for very specific WooCommerce shops, you might need to “communicate” to the user a product is already in the Cart before re-adding it or increasing its quantity from the Shop/Category/Loop and Single Product pages.

The “Add to Cart” button label comes with a filter (actually 2 filters, one for the Single Product page and another for the other pages such as Shop), so all we need to do is targeting those two, “filter” the label text in case the product is already in the Cart, and return that back to WooCommerce. If this looks like Japanese to you don’t worry – simply copy/paste the snippet below!
